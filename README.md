# Tiled-Terrain-System
A This repository contains an incomplete patent specification for a tiled terrain system that advances the state-of-the-art. I've decided not to continue with the patent process, but I intend to continue developing it as life allows and I believe it has value, so I'm publishing it on GitHub to make it available to the public.
